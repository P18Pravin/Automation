Assumptions and Environment Notes
OpenSearch Setup

The OpenSearch cluster is assumed to be running locally at http://localhost:9200.

For simplicity, basic authentication is hardcoded as admin:xxxx. In a production environment, credentials should be stored securely using Jenkins credentials or environment variables.

Output Behavior

The script writes the monitor configuration JSON to output/monitors.json.

The structure of the output matches what the business expects—each index gets a dedicated monitor with standard fields.

Script Functionality

The script fetches available indices from OpenSearch in real-time and generates monitor entries only for those currently present.

It scans for the keyword "error" in the message field—this is currently hardcoded for all monitors.

Notification channels are placeholders for now (notification_channel_1, notification_channel_2, etc.), and can be customized as needed.

Jenkins Pipeline Expectations

Assumes the Jenkins agent has Python 3 installed along with venv.

The pipeline installs Python dependencies at runtime using pip, so internet access is required on the Jenkins agent.

Extensibility & Future Enhancements

At the moment, the solution supports OpenSearch only.

Enhancements like adding filters for index patterns, custom log keywords, or multiple notification rules can be introduced by adjusting the Python function create_monitor_entry().

Security Considerations

The current implementation uses plain text credentials for simplicity.

For real deployments, the use of Jenkins withCredentials or integration with a secret manager (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) is recommended.
